HXMA FILE PARSER
================

Overview
--------

Hxma File Parser converts data files from the HXMA beamline at the Canadian Light Source into a cleaner format.

Usage
-----

First, download the files: [hxma-file-parser.py](). Next, make sure that you have Python and NumPy installed. In Ubuntu, you can do this by typing:  

`sudo apt-get install python python-numpy`  

Then, edit the `hxma-file-parser.py` file and insert the filenames where appropriate. Make sure to have the target file in the same directory as the python file.
